Chapter 2: Aadhi’s Struggle
In another small arena, far from the towering structure of Supreme’s domain, a boy walked out with his arms full of gifts and rewards. His name was Aadhi, and his face was beaming with pride. His steps were quick, almost hurried, as if he couldn’t wait to show off his success. The crowd around him cheered, but Aadhi barely noticed. His mind was already on the next competition, the next chance to prove himself.
As he made his way home, the streets grew darker and quieter. The slums were a stark contrast to the bright, bustling arena. Here, the air was thick with the smell of decay, and the people looked worn and tired, their faces hollow from years of suffering. Aadhi clutched his rewards tightly, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of danger.
Suddenly, a small figure stepped out from the darkness. It was a little boy, thin and ragged, his clothes hanging loosely from his bony frame. He approached Aadhi with hesitant steps, his eyes wide with desperation.
“Brother, please,” the boy whispered, his voice trembling. “Can you spare some food?”
Aadhi stopped, his face twisting into a mix of annoyance and disbelief. “Food? Why should I give you anything?” he snapped, his voice sharp and cold.
The little boy flinched but didn’t back down. “I’m hungry, brother. Just a little, please,” he pleaded again, his voice breaking.
Aadhi’s patience wore thin. “Get out of my way!” he shouted, shoving the boy aside. But the little boy, driven by hunger, grabbed Aadhi’s arm.
“Please, brother, just a little help!” he cried, his grip surprisingly strong for someone so frail.
This sparked Aadhi’s anger. He pushed the boy hard, making him stumble and fall to the ground. The boy got up, tears streaming down his face, and lunged at Aadhi, trying to grab the bag of rewards. Aadhi reacted quickly, dodging and shoving him back.
“You want to fight? Fine!” Aadhi yelled, his voice echoing through the empty streets.
The two tussled, the little boy swinging wildly but weakly, while Aadhi defended himself with rough shoves and slaps. It wasn’t a fair fight—Aadhi was stronger, but the boy’s desperation kept him going. They scuffled through the streets, knocking over a trash can and drawing a few curious glances from passersby.
Finally, Aadhi pinned the boy down, holding his arms tightly. “Enough!” he shouted, breathing heavily. The little boy stopped struggling, his body trembling as tears streamed down his face.
“I just wanted some food,” he sobbed, his voice barely audible.
Aadhi looked at him, his anger fading as he saw the boy’s bruised face and trembling body. He let go and stood up, brushing himself off. For a moment, he hesitated, then reached into his bag and pulled out a small packet of food.
“Here,” he muttered, tossing it to the boy.
The boy caught it, staring at Aadhi in surprise. “Thank you, brother,” he whispered, his voice filled with gratitude.
Aadhi looked away, his face softening. “I’m... I’m sorry,” he said quietly, before turning and walking away. His steps were slower now, as if weighed down by something he couldn’t quite name.
When Aadhi reached home, the sight was no better. The slums were a maze of crumbling buildings and narrow, dark streets. The air was thick with the stench of garbage and despair. His parents were waiting for him, their faces lighting up as he handed them the rewards.
“SUPREME never leaves us in hard situations,” they said, their voices filled with reverence. But Aadhi noticed something—they praised Supreme more than they praised him.
The next day, two soldiers arrived to take him to the big arena. Aadhi’s heart raced as he climbed the stairs to the stage, his hands and legs trembling. He had seen Supreme before, but this time, the fear was overwhelming.
When it was his turn, Aadhi stepped forward and sang an old Tamizh song, one written by an unpopular author. The audience watched in silence, their faces unreadable. When he finished, he was lined up with the other performers, waiting for the results.
The lights above their heads began to blink. Aadhi’s heart pounded as he waited, his mind filled with fear. The people with green lights were rewarded first and left happily. Those left behind were terrified, their eyes fixed on Supreme.
But then, something unexpected happened.
