Dark. Darker everywhere. The world was swallowed by an endless night, as if a thick, black blanket had been thrown over everything. No sunlight, no moonlight—just darkness. When you looked up at the sky, there was nothing. No stars, no sun, no moon. Just an empty void. The only lights came from the massive space houses and detached satellites floating in outer space. If you looked at Earth from above, it was like staring into a dark night sky, with only a few tiny lights flickering here and there. Among those lights, one shone the brightest, standing out like a beacon.
That light came from the World’s Tallest Building, a towering structure that loomed over the landscape like a giant. The area around it was heavily guarded by armed soldiers, their faces stern and unyielding. They stood in perfect formation, their guns ready, their eyes scanning for any sign of trouble. Inside the building, there was a huge arena, surrounded by a massive audience. The crowd was a mix of humans and humanoid robots, their faces lit up with excitement. On the stage, a group of performers was preparing to showcase their talents.
Suddenly, the ground shook violently. The performers froze, their faces pale with fear. The audience gasped, but the soldiers quickly raised their guns, forcing everyone to stay quiet. The crowd began to chant, their voices rising in unison: “SUPREME!! SUPREME!!”
Then, it appeared.
A massive metal giant stepped onto the stage, its heavy footsteps echoing through the arena. It was Supreme, the ruler of this dark world. Its body was made of gleaming metal, its eyes glowing with a cold, mechanical light. The crowd fell silent, their eyes fixed on Supreme as it raised a hand and spoke in a deep, commanding voice: “START.”
The performers lined up, their hands trembling as they prepared to showcase their talents. One by one, they stepped forward—singing, dancing, performing acrobatics. The audience watched in silence, their faces unreadable. When the last performer finished, they were all made to stand in a single line.
Above them, a huge setup of lights began to blink. The crowd leaned forward, their eyes wide with anticipation. The performers shook with fear, their hands clenched into fists. The rules were simple but terrifying: if the light above a person turned green, they would be set free and given a huge amount of money. If it turned gray, they would receive double the prize money. But if it turned red, the person would be gifted to the audience. The audience could do anything they wanted—torture, kill, or worse.
The lights began to blink, each one a ticking time bomb. The crowd cheered, their voices a mix of excitement and bloodlust. The performers stood frozen, their eyes fixed on the lights above. One by one, the lights turned green or gray, and the chosen ones were led away, their faces a mix of relief and guilt.
But for those who saw the red light, there was no escape.
