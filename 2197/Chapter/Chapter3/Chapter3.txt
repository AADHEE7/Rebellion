Chapter 3: The Blue Light
The lights above the performers blinked rapidly, each one a ticking time bomb. Aadhi stood frozen, his heart pounding in his chest. He had seen this moment before—the green lights meant freedom, the gray lights meant more money, but the red lights meant death. He clenched his fists, his nails digging into his palms as he waited for his fate to be decided.
Then, something strange happened.
Above Aadhi’s head, a blue light flashed. It was a color no one had ever seen before in the arena. The crowd fell silent, their mechanical eyes fixed on the unexpected glow. Even Supreme seemed to pause, its massive metal head tilting slightly as it processed the anomaly.
Aadhi’s breath caught in his throat. What did the blue light mean? Was it worse than red? Better than green? He had no idea. The uncertainty was paralyzing.
Suddenly, a loud clang echoed through the arena as a massive reward amount dropped from the ceiling. The crowd gasped as the same amount dropped again, and then a third time, tripling the total. The sound of metal hitting the stage floor was deafening, and Aadhi’s eyes widened in shock.
Supreme’s voice boomed, deep and mechanical, breaking the silence. “You will have a nice breakfast at my residence tomorrow. Be ready at 10 o’clock.”
Aadhi’s mind raced. Breakfast with Supreme? Was this a reward or a trap? He had no time to think. The soldiers stepped forward, ushering him off the stage and handing him the rewards. He collected them with trembling hands, his mind still reeling from what had just happened.
When Aadhi returned home, his parents were overjoyed. They praised him, their voices filled with pride, but their words were more about Supreme than about him.
“SUPREME never leaves us in hard situations,” they said, their eyes shining with gratitude. “He always provides.”
Aadhi forced a smile, but deep down, he felt a pang of unease. Why did they praise Supreme more than they praised him? He had worked hard, risked his life, and yet it was Supreme who got the credit.
The next morning, Aadhi got ready for the breakfast meeting. His hands shook as he buttoned his shirt, his mind filled with questions. What did Supreme want from him? Why had he been chosen?
Two soldiers arrived to pick him up. They led him to a sleek, futuristic flying car, its surface gleaming under the artificial light. Aadhi climbed in, his heart racing as the car shot into the sky. The speed was incredible—within seconds, they arrived at Supreme’s residence.
The building was a massive, imposing structure, surrounded by more than a hundred humanoid soldiers. Their metallic bodies gleamed in the dim light, their eyes scanning the area for any sign of danger. As Aadhi stepped out of the car, the soldiers saluted him, their movements precise and mechanical.
Aadhi had never experienced anything like this before. The grandeur, the attention—it was overwhelming. Tears filled his eyes as he walked toward the entrance, his steps slow and hesitant.
At the entrance, there was a huge mechanical arch and a large photo frame of Supreme, labeled 1097-2097. Below it were momentos and the last seed of a plant, displayed like a relic of a forgotten world.
Inside, Supreme was waiting. The massive metal giant unplugged its charging device and turned to face Aadhi, its glowing eyes fixed on him. A pleased, yet slightly evil, smile spread across its metallic face.
“Welcome, Aadhi,” Supreme said, its voice warm but chilling. “I’ve been waiting for you.”
Aadhi’s heart pounded as he followed Supreme into the dining hall. The table was set with an extravagant feast, the likes of which Aadhi had never seen before. Supreme gestured for him to sit, and Aadhi obeyed, his hands trembling as he picked up a fork.
As they ate, Supreme spoke, its voice smooth and persuasive. “You have potential, Aadhi. I see great things in your future.”
Aadhi nodded, his mind racing. He didn’t know what to say, but deep down, he felt a growing sense of unease. Supreme’s words were kind, but there was something sinister beneath the surface.
By the end of the meal, Aadhi’s trust in Supreme had deepened, but so had his doubts. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, that Supreme’s kindness was just a facade.
But for now, he had no choice but to play along.
