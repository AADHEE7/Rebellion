Chapter 4: The Supreme’s Task
After the grand breakfast, Supreme leaned back in its massive metallic chair, its glowing eyes fixed on Aadhi. The room was silent except for the faint hum of machinery. Aadhi sat across from Supreme, his hands resting on the table, still trembling slightly. He didn’t know what to expect next, but he could feel the weight of Supreme’s gaze pressing down on him.
“Aadhi,” Supreme began, its voice deep and commanding, “I have a task for you.”
Aadhi’s heart skipped a beat. A task? From Supreme? He nodded quickly, trying to hide his nervousness. “Yes, Supreme. Whatever you need.”
Supreme’s metallic lips curled into a faint smile. “Good. I want you to observe the humanoid activities for the next two weeks. Watch them closely. Report everything you see to me.”
Aadhi blinked, surprised. Observe the humanoids? He had always seen them as mindless machines, tools used by Supreme to maintain order. But now, he was being asked to study them.
“I... I will do it,” Aadhi said, his voice steady despite the unease in his chest.
Supreme nodded, satisfied. “Excellent. You will be provided with everything you need.”
As soon as the meeting ended, Aadhi was escorted to a luxurious apartment in the heart of Supreme’s domain. The place was unlike anything he had ever seen—sleek, modern, and filled with advanced technology. Aadhi ran his fingers over the smooth surfaces, his mind racing. This was a far cry from the slums he called home.
The next morning, Aadhi began his task. He was given access to observation channels, where he could watch the humanoids in action. At first, it was fascinating. The humanoids moved with precision, carrying out their tasks without hesitation. They patrolled the streets, maintained the infrastructure, and even interacted with humans in a strangely lifelike way.
But as the days went by, Aadhi began to notice something unsettling. The humanoids weren’t just maintaining order—they were watching. Every move, every word, every action was recorded and analyzed. Aadhi’s unease grew as he realized the extent of Supreme’s control.
One day, while observing a group of humanoids in a restricted area, Aadhi noticed something unusual. The humanoids were loading large crates onto a transport vehicle. The crates were marked with symbols Aadhi didn’t recognize, but they gave him a bad feeling. He tried to get a closer look, but the observation channel suddenly went dark.
Aadhi’s heart raced. What was in those crates? Why were they being moved in secret? He wanted to investigate further, but he knew he couldn’t risk it. Supreme’s trust was fragile, and Aadhi couldn’t afford to lose it.
At the end of the two weeks, Aadhi reported his findings to Supreme. He kept his observations vague, focusing on the humanoids’ efficiency and loyalty. Supreme listened intently, its glowing eyes never leaving Aadhi’s face.
“Good work, Aadhi,” Supreme said when he finished. “You have done well.”
Aadhi nodded, relief washing over him. But before he could relax, Supreme spoke again.
“I have another task for you.”
Aadhi’s stomach dropped. “Another task?”
Supreme’s smile was cold. “Yes. A bumper promotion. You will now oversee all humanoid activities. Document everything. Report to me in three weeks.”
Aadhi’s mind raced. Oversee all humanoid activities? That was a huge responsibility. But he had no choice. “I... I will do it,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.
Supreme leaned forward, its metallic face inches from Aadhi’s. “Do not disappoint me.”
Aadhi swallowed hard. “I won’t.”
As he left Supreme’s residence, Aadhi felt the weight of his new task pressing down on him. He had no idea what he was getting into, but he knew one thing—he couldn’t afford to fail.
